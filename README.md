# 01-homework Horiseon Project 
As a developer I have made sure that all links in the application function properly.
The application's CSS selectors and properties have been consolidated and organised
to follow swmantic structure.
The application's CSS file has been commented on.

Here is a screen shot of the application

In the HTML.index files I refactored the code without changing the application's function by adding semantic HTML tags in place of all the Div tags and cleaned up the code.
User Story
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines


Acceptance Criteria
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the icon and image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

Satisfies all of the preceding acceptance criteria plus the following code improvements:

Application's links all function correctly.

Application's CSS selectors and properties are consolidated and organized to follow semantic structure.

Application's CSS file is properly commented.
